# My Portfolio Site 🌟  

Hey there! 👋 Welcome to the codebase for my personal portfolio site: **[tawananyasha.com](https://tawananyasha.com/)**.  

This is where I showcase my work, skills, and projects (plus a bit of my personality 😄). I decided to share the code so you can see how I built it and maybe get some inspiration for your own portfolio or Next.js adventures!

## Live Demo 🚀

## Why Open Source? 🤔  

I believe in learning and growing together! Sharing this project is my way of helping others understand how to:
- Use **Next.js** for a blazing-fast and SEO-friendly site.  
- Style with **TailwindCSS** for a modern and responsive design.  
- Host and deploy your portfolio.  

---

## Tech Stack 💻  

Here’s what makes the magic happen:  
- **Framework**: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (for the fast and flexible React-based experience).  
- **Styling**: [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) (because it’s clean, minimal, and so much fun to use).  
- **Deployment**: Deployed using [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

## Features ✨  

- **About Me Section**: A short, sweet intro to who I am.  
- **Projects Gallery**: A showcase of my projects (with links to repos and live demos).  
- **Contact Form**: Get in touch with me directly through the site.  
- **Responsive Design**: Looks great on desktops, tablets, and phones!  
- **SEO-Optimized**: Meta tags and structured data to help my site shine on search engines.
