        As an active member of my church, i noticed we were javing trouble with our projection software. It would constantly crash, and also there was the problem that HDMI cables kept dying. So to eliminate the concept of projecting while close to the project, i create an application that can project from afar. It creates a wireless connection with 2 computers, allowing them to communicate. 1 gives the data to project, the other only receives this information and displays it.
